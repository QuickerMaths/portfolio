TagsOverflow is a user-friendly React application that enables users to efficiently search 
through tags, fetched directly from the Stack Overflow API. The application features a clean 
and simple design, enhanced with practical functionalities such as data prefetching, lazy 
loading of components, and responsive loading states. These features, along with subtle 
animations, ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Overview

- **State Menagment:** I've choose to use the <code>Context API</code> with combination of <code>useReducer</code> hook due to the application's simplicity and size. It manages a form state for handling tags, using 
a reducer for state updates. The provider exposes an API with functions to dispatch actions to the reducer. Notably, it integrates with React Query to fetch data whenever the state changes, 
using axios for HTTP requests. This ensures efficient data fetching and synchronization, providing a smooth user experience. The state and API are made accessible to any component that calls 
the <code>useTagsProvider</code> hook.

- **Data fetching:** Data fetching is being handled by tanstack query and axios inside of HOC which makes it easy to test. Fetching statrts as soon as possibe thanks to react's-router loader functionality, this makes sure that user can 
see result as soon as possible. Application also utalizes data caching by using <code>query keys</code> and <code>keepPrevoiusData</code> provided by tanstack query application avoids unnecessary
API calls, that makes it very performent even on devices with slow internet connection.

- **Form:** implemented shadcn.ui and react-hook-form. Form provides a complex filtering funtionality, like search, sorting, number of tags per page, pagination serching withing certain time range 
and specifing of maximum and minimum of realted posts. Whole form is bedounced to avoid unnecessary API calls. Besides that shadcn components provides greate accessibility

- **Error Boundires:** TagsOverflow provides great user experience even if error occures by using react-error-boundires and custom error fallbacks that informs users taht something went wrong.

- **Lazy loading and skeleton components:** Thanks to lazy loading and suspense user is able to see first conent on his screen as soon as possible even with slow internet connection, skeleton components makes 
user experience very smooth and avoids any Cumulative Layout Shifts.

- **Data validaton:** data is being validated uing zod. Validation occures when user inputs serach queries into the form, that provides descriptive error messages if some input is invalid. 
Besides thats incoming data from API is also validated by proper type schema and <code>parse</code> function from zod, which provides type safe response from API and makes code more maintanable.

- **Components:** for component library i choose shadcn.ui, which provides greate developer experince as it is easy to use, very cusomizble and provides great accessiblity features. 

- **Tests:** Applications components are fully tested by Storybook, which make codebase maintanable and easy to develop in the future.

- **Animations:** There is one simple animaton done with framer-motion that makes user experience even more pleasent.

- **Best pracices:** This codebase is full on best practices such as conssistent naming convention, good project structure, separation of concers, mocking in the test files and mentioned above
data caching and validation, error handling, lazy loading.
