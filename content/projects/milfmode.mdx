Hello! I recently had the opportunity to work on a project using MedusaJs, a headless commerce engine, and NextJs, a React framework. This experience allowed me to delve deeper into a larger codebase, implement existing functionalities, and customize them according to the project's needs.

## Frontend Development

The frontend was built using the NextJs Medusa starting template, which I customized to meet the project's requirements. Here are some of the key features I implemented:

- **Animated Header and Mobile Menu:** I created a custom header and mobile menu with animations using Framer Motion, a motion library for React.
- **Side Cart Menu and Pre-cart Modal:** I designed a side cart menu and a pre-cart modal that allows users to add more products before navigating to checkout. ![website side cart modal screenshot](/images/milfmode/milfmode-side-cart-modal.png) 
- **Multilingual Support:** I used the next-intl package to translate the website into English and integrated it with MedusaJs's Region Select functionality. This allows users to change the page translation along with the delivery region.
- **Image Carousel and Size Guide:** I implemented an image carousel in the product details view using the Swiper package and a size guide modal that reads values from collection metadata. ![website product details page screenshot](/images/milfmode/milfmode-product-detail.png) 
- **Quick Add Functionality:** and implemented a "quick add" functionality that allows users to add products from various pages without navigating to the product detail page. ![website quick add feature screenshot](/images/milfmode/milfmode-quick-add.png) 
- **Wishlist:** I integrated MedusaJs's wishlist plugin that allows logged in users to save products and then buy them later. ![website wishlist page screenshot](/images/milfmode/milfmode-wishlist.png)  
- **Product Filters:** Refactored product filters to allow filtering by multiple categories simultaneously. ![website product filtering gif](/images/milfmode/milfmode-filters.gif)
- **Google Authentication:** I implemented Google's authentication provider.

## Backend Development

On the backend, I extended the core product entity and product_collection entity to add new fields and functionalities:

- **Product Entity:** I added a secondary_thumbnail field for displaying a second product picture on hover, an is_new field for showcasing new collections, and models_height and models_size fields to assist clients with size selection. ![website quick add functionality and thumbnail hover gif](/images/milfmode/milfmode-quick-add-and-second-thumbnail.gif) 
- **Product Collection Entity:** I added collection_desktop and collection_mobile fields to store images that appear on the home page and in the main collection pages. ![website collection page screenshot](/images/milfmode/milfmode-collection.png) 
- **Custom Widgets:** For all these entity extensions, I implemented custom widgets in the store admin panel, enabling the client to manage these fields without any programming skills.
- **Amazon S3 Integration:** I implemented image storage on Amazon's S3 Bucket.

## Conclusion

This project was a testament to my skills as a full-stack developer, showcasing my ability to understand and work with complex codebases, implement and customize functionalities, and create user-friendly, efficient, and robust solutions. 

Working with MedusaJs and NextJs, I was able to build a comprehensive e-commerce platform that not only met the client's requirements but also provided a seamless user experience. The project allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in frontend development, backend development, and third-party integrations.

The frontend was enhanced with custom animations, multilingual support, an image carousel, a wishlist feature, and a quick add functionality, among other features. On the backend, I extended the core product and product collection entities, implemented custom widgets for easy management, and integrated Amazon S3 for image storage.

The successful completion of this project has further solidified my expertise in full-stack development. I am confident in my ability to take on complex projects, adapt to new technologies, and deliver efficient and reliable solutions. I look forward to bringing these skills to new challenges in the future.
