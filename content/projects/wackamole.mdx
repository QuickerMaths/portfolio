I'm thrilled to share one of my recent projects, a Whack-A-Mole game. This project is a fun and interactive game built using React and TypeScript, demonstrating my ability to create engaging web applications.

## Technical Stack

The game is built using React, a popular library for building user interfaces. I used TypeScript to add static types to the JavaScript code, making it easier to maintain and understand.

For a faster development experience, I used Vite as the build tool. It provides a development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

## Game Features

The game includes a home page where users can select the difficulty level and the number of lives for the game. This is achieved using React-Select, a flexible and customizable Select Input control for ReactJS.

The game page displays the score and the number of lives. The core game logic is encapsulated in the MoleGrid component, which randomly pops up moles in a grid. Users can click on them to increase their score, and if a mole is not clicked in time, the user loses a life.

## Routing and Styling

The application uses React Router for routing, allowing for easy navigation between different components of the game.

For styling, I used CSS modules, which let me write CSS that's scoped locally to individual components, ensuring styles do not clash across the application.

## Conclusion

This Whack-A-Mole game project has been a great learning experience for me, allowing me to delve deeper into modern web development technologies like React and TypeScript. It has helped me improve my skills and understanding of these tools, as well as the importance of writing clean and maintainable code. I am eager to continue learning and applying these skills in future projects to further enhance my web development capabilities.
